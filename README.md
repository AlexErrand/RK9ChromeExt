# Extreme Speed - VGC Companion

Welcome to Extreme Speed - VGC Companion! This is an RK9Labs Extension that allows you to use your showdown paste to submit your team for real life VGC events with ease.

Say goodbye to the tedious manual entry of each stat and the long 20-minute team sheet fill-outs. With our extension, you can efficiently submit your team in just about 40 seconds! Enjoy the added convenience of importing your team directly from Pokémon Showdown. 

Note: Extreme Speed - VGC Companion is not affiliated with RK9Labs, Nintendo, Game Freak, Pokémon Showdown or The Pokémon Company International. Please always make sure that the team submitted here matches the team in your console, and that your Pokémon are appropriately leveled prior to importing your team for accurate results. This tool does not submit your team for you, the user
is fully responsible for their submission.
